Imperative programming

Content

Hey folks,

The "While" language we looked at in class is inspired by this chapter.

Hoare's seminal paper on verification. This sets the stage for formal
imperative logic, (imperative programming itself had already been around for a
decade). The wiki page on it is a bit easier to digest. Finally, Hoare
verifies a small, but real program: find.

PA7 / PA8 Due Dates

Content

PA7 late due date will be pushed to Wednesday of next week (4/12).

This does not affect:

1\. The early due date for extra credit

2\. HW7 due date

3\. HW8/PA8 release dates

I recommend working to get the assignment completed by Sunday as usual and
only using the extra days if necessary.

Similarly, PA8 will have a few extra days, until the following Sunday (4/23).

The early due date remains the Thursday after release (4/13).

TypeClasses Review sheet

Hey folks, since I am out of office hours this week, I am posting solutions to
the review for the type classes sheet.

I highly recommend trying to work this out before checking the sheet and if
you can, check only one answer at a time. A lot of these problems can be easy
to convince yourself that you understand the answer once you see it, but the
only way to be sure is to do it.

Using "if" in Haskell

Content

Folks, I am seeing a lot of code submissions using "let ... in ..." and "if
... else ...".

While these constructs exist in Haskell, I strongly recommend against using
them to solve the PA.

For example, I want to write a function in JavaScript which executes `A` when
my input `n `is greater than zero and `B` otherwise,

    
    
    let fun = (n) => {
    	if (n > 0) {
    		A();
    	} else {
    		B();
    	}
    }

Writing the same function in Haskell:

    
    
    fun n
    	| n > 0     = A
    	| otherwise = B -- otherwise is a keyword in haskell to catch other cases
    	| n <= 0    = B -- this line would also work instead of the "otherwise" line

Consider factorial in javascript:

    
    
    let factorial = (n) => {
    	if (n <= 1) {
    		return 1;
    	}
    	return n * factorial(n);
    }

Same thing in Haskell:

    
    
    factorial 0 = 1
    factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

Here the function has two definitions: one for if the input is 0 and one for
if the input is not zero. (What happens if the input is negative?)

Real life closures

Content

In class there was a question regarding, "when will we use this idea" with
respect to closures.

It's a fair question, and one that is better to answer with real code than a
hypothetical.

Closures are perhaps one of the most common powerful tools that you'll use in
industry projects.

Attached here is a simplified version of an evaluation script I use for a
client.

The idea of the script is to run many different experiments and compare the
accuracies of the hypotheses.

Take a look at the `create_experiment` function. The purpose here is to create
a closure capturing specific information about the experimental run.

Take a look at the `compose` function. Here I am storing two functions that I
will want to use together later.

Could I have written it a different way? Definitely.

Is this way more concise? Definitely.

This is just one example, we will dive further into closures in unit 2.

Important Midterm Update

Content

Folks,

**I am moving the midterm to Monday, March 6.**

We are behind where I expected us to be in the course content (which is fine)
and it would not be fair to you all to test you on Haskell and Type Inference
when we have not given them adequate attention in lecture.

This means: Monday Feb 27's lecture will be on Type Inference & Haskell,
Wednesday March 1's lecture will be Midterm review.

Also: I am **delaying the late due dates for Homework 4 and PA 4** to be
_next_ Sunday, March 5. This should give you plenty of time to digest the
material from Types and to study for the midterm.

Gradescope so slow

ContentI don't know if you have encountered the same situation as me, but my
gradescope is extremely slow when running tests, especially when 7 files are
uploaded together. When I upload interp2 and 6 individually, both get 3
points. But when I upload all the files together, I get a point deducted from
both 2 and 6 for being too slow.

Nested Replies: 1Yeah, it’s significantly slower than previous PAs. That said, I think that’s
to be expected. The tests are quite computationally complex.

  

I would try a couple things, (1) double check your implementation and make
sure it follows the instructions and (2) keep resubmitting all 7 files. It can
take a couple tries for everything to pass, even when you’re not changing
anything in any of the files.

Q 1.1

ContentIn class we covered cps conversion for function declarations but not for
function calls. What should we be using as the new parameter for cc when we
are writing a function call?

Nested Replies: 1

Maybe I'm misinterpreting your question so just let me know.

Given:

    
    
    function f(x, y) {
    	return x + y
    }

We need to convert it to CPS. So, as you say, we declare a new parameter
called "cc."

    
    
    function f(x, y, cc) {
    	cc(x + y)
    }

So, instead of returning, we pass it into a deeper layer of the call stack of
a function that we define as cc in our parameter. What does cc do? We can
define this whenever we call the function **f.**

****

Let's say, without CPS, we want to do:

    
    
    function f(x, y) {
    	return x + y
    }
    
    print(10 + f(2,3))

With CPS, we can no longer use (10 + f(2,3)) syntax since **f no longer
returns a value.** But, we know that the "return value" of f will be passed
into the parameter function **cc.** So, we can do this:

    
    
    function f(x, y, cc) {
    	cc(x + y)
    }
    
    f(2, 3, ret => { # <-- This anonymous function will be passed into the cc parameter
    	print(ret + 10);
    })

As I wrote in my comment, the key thing to be aware of is that **when we call
the function f, we define an anonymous function that is passed as the cc
value.** This cc function, as defined in our function f, takes the "return"
value (x + y in our case) as the argument. Since the cc function is defined as
the ret => {} portion, ret will be assigned to the x + y value, and we do
print(ret + 10), which has the same functionality as our non-CPS version.

Does that help clarify a little bit? Let me know if I didn't answer your
question! I also think CPS is a little tricky to understand. It's a lot of
moving parts, so doing a lot of examples will help develop a sort of intuition
of how to use it.

With all of the interp files filled out according to the instructions, there
is no time error on Gradescope. If you’re getting this, there’s likely a
runtime or compile-time problem in your code. _Before_ submitting to
Gradescope, I’d suggest trying all of the following:

  1. Implement all of the interp files (interp1-interp7)
  2. In the pa08 directory… 
    1. run “cabal check” and address any terminal output
    2. run “cabal clippy” and address any terminal output
    3. run “cabal fmt”
    4. For each interp file… (interp1-interp7) 
      1. run “cargo run --release --bin interp1 bf/bench.bf” (outputs the alphabet in reverse)
      2. run “cargo run --release --bin interp1 bf/hanoi.bf” (outputs a towers of hanoi animation)
      3. run “cargo run --release --bin interp1 bf/hello.bf” (outputs the good ol' hello world)

PA8 interp2 bmap is vector?

Content

I am confused as to why bmap is a vector in PA8 interp2, should not it be a
HashMap?

Nested Replies: 1

I guess my question is actually if we can change the definition of bmap to
look like this in interp2:

    
    
    let mut bmap = vec![0; prog.len()];

Because without this, it panics b/c the length of the map is 0.

Nested Replies: 2

You can also push 0 for each place while we are going through the program
array.

Nested Replies: 1

Not sure if we can use a hashmap (I'll wait on other instructors to comment on
it!), but you can still use the vector with the same functionality as a
hashmap.

One way way to think about this is for every "character" of the expression, we
add a corresponding cell in the vector. So, for "[>>>>]", we will have a
vector of length 6.

So, you can think of the "character's index" as the key of that hashmap, and
whatever you're storing as the "value" of the hashmap. What we store as the
key will depend on your implementation, but it will relate to the positioning
of the "[" and "]" characters, or what we are trying to optimize.

Does that make sense? Again, another instructor can comment on whether just
using a hashmap is valid! :)

Nested Replies: 1

thank you, Eric! that makes sense. I guess I was rather asking if there is any
benefit here to using a vector instead of a HashMap

Nested Replies: 2

yep, again I'm not 100% sure if it's okay, so I'll leave this unresolved until
another instructor comes around and answers it. Just wanted to give some tips
in case people had the same question later

Nested Replies: 2

From my understanding, if we make bmap to be the same size of the prog.len()
and storing the jump position only for '[' and ']', it should run faster than
hash. It is because running the hash function is additional overhead (though
it might be small). This method and using hashmap is also O(1) (Retrieve
element using index and lookup of hash), but retrieving element using index
will be faster. Obviously, it will consume more memory space.

Nested Replies: 2

yeah, that probably it

Confusion on functionality of Rand and Cond

ContentI am a bit confused about what the functionality of Rand and Cond is supposed
to be. For Rand, are you supposed to pull anything from the stack and then
overwrite the value with a random number or just generate a new value and push
it? Similar confusion as to what values are needed to evaluate Cond.

Nested Replies: 1

So for Rand, you want to pop the first element from the stack, and (if it is
greater than zero), generate a random number between 0 and that number. Then
push this number to the stack.

For Cond, you want to get three things from the stack (from the user input),
which should be a boolean, and two integers. If the boolean is true, you want
to push the first integer from the user input onto the stack. If it is false,
you want to push the other one.

Hope that helps!

I think that the assignment called "Overall" shows your actual grade (up until

Your guess is as good as mine on this one. Canvas and Gradescope have buggy

Pa6 step function

If there are not enough items on the stack should the function failure be an

you can return "Nothing," which is another alternative constructor for the

PA6 Gradescope test error

Content

I have met a weird problem.

When I submitted my code to gradescope, it gives me error about simplifyZero
method.

The info is that
![](/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fkt3d3i9sjpu5y%2Fc53911cb1e5751b0a9eae52ebc335d8cfa9b2ea7f6b22a6c61bb90af98d3ae31%2F1.png)

However, when I resubmit it again, it gives different error

![](/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fkt3d3i9sjpu5y%2F539ea82247b4d1b6bec467eb8d0ed061150dc64693128b1a454a04db2505b6c9%2F3.png)  
  
For these error cases, I modified Test.hs to test them and they are working
fine on my local
end.![image.png](/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fkt3d3i9sjpu5y%2Ff2873c54229bd87c8abe437d82294b324956c9a87ea925342772ffa27fd6f8bf%2Fimage.png)![image.png](/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fkt3d3i9sjpu5y%2F40edf20e51dadbd5c265250a197a7174722723a4c741a352f9329b5393cc91e8%2Fimage.png)  
Can someone explain what should I do with it? Really can't find a way to debug
it.

Nested Replies: 1same problem here

Nested Replies: 1

So, for our implementation of simplifyZero, we want to be simplifying just for
**addition operations.** So, calling simplifyZero (Op Times (Lit 0) (Lit 0))
should just return (Op Times (Lit 0) (Lit 0)) since it's multiplication.

PA06 11) decompile is inverse of compile (0/5)

Content

I believe there may be an error with the last test block of PA06.  
I fail this test:  
  
*** Failed! Falsified (after 18 tests):  
Op Minus (Lit 7) (Lit (-1))  
Just (Op Minus (Lit (-1)) (Lit 7)) /= Just (Op Minus (Lit 7) (Lit (-1)))  
Use --quickcheck-replay=860350 --quickcheck-max-size=10 to reproduce.  
  
I don't believe the inverses would be equal to each other with the minus
operation.  
EX) -1 - 7 = -8 but 7 - -1 = 8

Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Nested Replies: 1

Without looking at your code, I think this means you are pushing back onto the
stack in the reverse order of what is expected.

For reference the test code is: `decompile (compile e) === Just e` which means
start with an expression e (e.g. Op Minus (Lit 7) (Lit (-1))), compile that,
then decompile it. The result should be (Op Minus (Lit 7) (Lit (-1))) but you
are returning Just (Op Minus (Lit 7) (Lit (-1))) instead

Class today (3/29) cancelled

Hey folks class today is going to be cancelled.

With respect to problem #2 on the homework, since we didn't spend much time
covering Smalltalk, I will be halving the points for those problems (only 6
points total). The problems do not actually require much more knowledge than
the activation records we covered and a bit of critical thinking. The
assignments will still be due this Sunday.

dOrdXY

Content

I am having some trouble with dOrdXY, and I just wanted to know if I could get
some help on how to get started?

Nested Replies: 1

In the given type definition of dOrdXY, the `dOrdXY` function takes two
arguments of type `Ord a` and `Ord b` respectively, and returns an instance of
the `Ord` type class for pairs of values of types `a` and `b`. You need to
define the a new instance of Ord with the Ord class definition and compare
function. You can follow the pattern provided in the comments.

Invisible Text in Lecture Slides 🥲

Hi,

Some of the text in the lecture slides for type-classes is visible. Was this
intentional? If not, could this be fixed?

I often refer back to the lecture slides when I get stuck in problems, so it
would be a great help if this could be fixed.

Thank you!

Are we using all lines/blanks?

ContentFor this homework, we are requested to fill in the blank. I want to make sure
whether we have to use all the lines or not. e.g. We have three lines on part
1.2.1.a on pop (Stack s) = ..., and is this intended as we have to put three
lines of code?

Nested Replies: 1

Maybe another instructor can comment on whether or not it's okay to just use 1
line vs. 3 lines, but I just wanted to follow-up with a way of interpreting
the 3 line implementation.

One way to think of the three line implementation is just using one line to
check if the given Stack/Queue matches to empty list, then carry out the
following procedures (these parts are very similar to the previous
implementations)

Edit to add: if you can solve it in one line, and the solution is correct, you
will get full points.
